The trach tube bypasses these mechanisms, so that the air moving through the tube is cooler, dryer and not as clean.  In response to these changes, the body produces more mucus.  Suctioning clears mucus from the tracheostomy tube and is essential for proper breathing. Also, secretions left in the tube could become contaminated and a chest infection could develop.  Avoid suctioning too frequently as this could lead to more secretion buildup\u003c/e\u003e\n"},"20":{"3.2) WHEN TO SUCTION:":"\nSuctioning is important to prevent a mucus plug from blocking the tube and stopping the patient\u0027s breathing.  Suctioning should be considered\n1. Any time the patient feels or hears mucus rattling in the tube or airway\n2. In the morning when the patient first wakes up\n3. When there is an increased respiratory rate (working hard to breathe)\n4. Before meals\n5. Before going outdoors\n6. Before going to sleep\u003c/e\u003e\n"},"21":{"3.3) NOTE:":"\nThe secretions should be white or clear. If they start to change color, (e.g. yellow, brown or green) this may be a sign of infection. If the changed color persists for more than three days or if it is difficult to keep the tracheostomy tube intact, call Physician. If there is blood in the secretions (it may look more pink than red), you should initially increase humidity and suction more gently. \u003c/e\u003e\n"},"22":{"3.4) EQUIPMENTS:":"\n1.

Tracheostomy brushes\n7. extra tracheostomy tube\n\u003c/e\u003e\n"},"23":{"3.5) PROCEDURES:":"\n1. Wash your hands and put  on gloves and gowns\n2. Cover the chest with mackintosh and towel\n3. Turn on the suction machine and connect the suction connection tubing to the machine.\n4. With the help of forceps, pick up suitable catheter and attach it to Y connection.\n5. Connect the catheter to the suction connection tubing.\n6. Lay the patient flat on his/her back with a small towel/blanket rolled under the shoulders. Some patients may prefer a sitting position which can also be tried.\nC:\\Users\\SUBHRA\\Downloads\\ns_v30_n35_46_0002.jpg \u003c/img\u003e\n7. Rinse the lumen of the catheter with normal saline and gently insert  into the trachea. Catheter is inserted usually 6-8 inches\n8. Do not apply suction during insertion by keeping the Y-vent open. Pull the catheter back to avoid blocking of bronchial stem\n9. Apply suction by using the Y vent . slowly withdraw the catheter rotating it and applying suction intermittently.\n10. Suction should not be continued for more than 5-10 seconds to prevent hypoxia.\n11. If the catheter is uncontaminated it could be re inserted if necessary, suction again after providing oxygenation.\n12. Turn off suction machine and discard catheter (clean according to step 3 if to be reused).\n13. Discard the catheter, the gloves and the bowl of saline solution.\n14. While suctioning tracheostomy following points should be remember:\u003clt1\u003e\n1. Be gentle because the tracheal mucosa can be easily traumatized during suctioning\n2. Vigorous suctioning of the tube can cause movement of the tracheostomy tube inside the trachea which is very uncomfortable.\n3. Suctions only secretions are audible.\n4. Postural drainage is recommended but do not put the patient in extremely low head position.\n5. Suctioning continuously for more than 15-20 sec may cause death.\n6. Appropriate suction catheter should be selected and lubricated with normal saline before introduced into the trachea.\n7. If the mucous is tenacious instill few drops of sterile normal saline to the tracheostomy tube.\n8. If during procedure patient cough take out catheter immediately.\n9. Auscultate the chest before and after suction to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure.\u003c/e\u003e\n"},"24":{"Head":"4) CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY\n4.1) INTRODUCTION:\nChest physiotherapy in the form of airway clearance techniques and exercise has played an important role in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Until the 1990s the primary airway clearance technique used was postural drainage combined with percussion and vibration (PD\u0026P). It was introduced into the treatment of CF with little evidence to support its efficacy and once established, it has been difficult ethically to perform a study comparing PD\u0026P to no treatment. A common question, yet unanswered is when should it be commenced, especially for the newly diagnosed asymptomatic CF patient? \u003c/e\u003e\n"},"25":{"4.2) DEFINITION: Chest physical therapy is the term for a group of treatments designed to improve respiratory efficiency, promote expansion of the lungs, strengthen respiratory muscles, and eliminate secretions from the respiratory system.\u003c/e\u003e":"\n"},"26":{"4.3) PURPOSE: To standardize the use of chest physiotherapy as a form of therapy using one or more techniques to optimize the effects of gravity and external manipulation of the thorax by postural drainage, percussion, vibration and cough.
